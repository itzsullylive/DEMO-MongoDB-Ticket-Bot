# DEMO-MongoDB-Ticket-Bot
This is a advanced ticket bot using MongoDB, but ofc, it's a demo! As I won't be open sourcing the actual version, this one is to get started, making amazing codes!
Make sure to run `cluster.js` not `index.js`!

⚠️ **CREDITS:**
> Dont change the text from the global variable, `client.getFooter` if you do, the code will return errors, as I hid many lines of code, stoping you from doing so!
